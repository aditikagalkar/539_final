            <p>
                In the midst of the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic, people all over the country have been forced into quarantine
                and isolation within their homes. Technology has allowed us to substitute many vital aspects of daily
                lives like education or the work place.
                <br />
                Although we are no longer required to live in isolation, we have learned that we can leverage technology
                to help us carry out common activities. A new international pandemic has increased our regular need in
                healthcare services.
                <br />
                How can we use technology to improve safe access to healthcare services for the public?

                    <p>Alisha is a college student, studying in a new state during the pandemic. Alisha relies on her
                        parents
                        financially, and they are of middle-class income. Alisha has been showing signs of illness the

                        few
                        days and wants to speak to a doctor. However, she has no means of transportation on her own, and
                        cannot
                        risk exposing others by using ride services. She also is not familiar with the doctors in her
                        college
                        town. She opens her app to see what she can find.</p>
